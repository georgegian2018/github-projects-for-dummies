# Core Concepts: Organization, Repository, Project

This section fixes the #1 beginner confusion: these are different things.

## 1) Organization (org)
An **Organization** is like a workspace that can own:
- repositories
- projects
- people / teams

Organizations are the only real way to “group repositories”.

✅ Example:
- `progenesis-research` (organization)

## 2) Repository (repo)
A **Repository** is where your content lives:
- code
- LaTeX papers
- figures
- datasets
- documentation

A repo belongs to either:
- your personal account, OR
- an organization

✅ Example:
- `progenesis-research/mdpi-paper-mmwave-v2x`

## 3) Project (GitHub Projects)
A **Project** is a planning tool (like Trello/Jira-lite):
- board view (Todo → In Progress → Done)
- table view (spreadsheet)
- roadmap view (timeline)

A project does NOT contain repositories.

### The key sentence
> Projects organize **work**. Repositories store **content**.

## Correct hierarchy (memorize this)
