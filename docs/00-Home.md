# GitHub Projects for Dummies (Home)

This tutorial explains GitHub Projects in a way GitHub rarely does: **simple, step-by-step, no vague jargon**.

If you are confused by Projects, it’s usually because of these problems:
- You expect Projects to work like folders for repositories (they don’t).
- You created a Project in your personal account but expected it to live in the organization.
- You tried to “link a project to a repo directly” (GitHub doesn’t work like that).

## The simplest summary
- **Organization** = container that can own repositories and projects
- **Repository** = where files/code/papers live
- **Project** = a task board that tracks work (cards), often using Issues
