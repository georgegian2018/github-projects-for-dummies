# Personal Projects vs Organization Projects (The UI Trap)

GitHub makes it easy to accidentally create Projects in the wrong place.

## Important rule
> A Project belongs to ONE owner:
- your personal account, OR
- an organization

It cannot belong to both.

## How to tell (this is the only reliable check)
### Personal project
You will see something like:
- `@yourusername’s Projects`

### Organization project
You will see:
- `org-name / Projects / project-name`

Example:
- `progenesis-research / Projects / Research Roadmap`

## Why this matters
If you create a project in your personal account but your repositories are in an organization:
- you’ll feel like nothing connects
- issues may not show up the way you expect
- you’ll keep fighting the interface

## Correct approach for research
If the org is for research:
- Create your Projects inside the org
- Create repos inside the org
- Link via Issues
